# HomeSickGame
This is the source for my RPG, Home Sick.



About the game:
- Home Sick is played from the perspective of a school student who has to “convince” (defeat) all their peers and teachers that they are sick so they can go home.
- Players win if they defeat all enemies in all rooms. Players lose if they are defeated. 
- Contains class hierarchy of the different type of players which made it possible to make three difficulties the player could play on; easy, normal and hard.
- Players can save and load the starting state of the room they are in.

Top play:
- Run the main file.
